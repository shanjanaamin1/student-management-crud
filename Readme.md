## Project Overview

## Brand Name and Guidelines

### Brand Name:
**Aether University**

### Guidelines:

1. **UI/UX**:
   - The system should have a clean and minimalistic design.
   - Use the color `#EEC15A` as the primary brand color in the interface, ensuring all pages are aligned with the brandâ€™s aesthetic.
   - Avoid overly complex layouts to maintain ease of use.

2. **Security**:
   - All passwords must be securely hashed before storage.
   - Use HTTPS (secure HTTP) for all pages requiring sensitive information.

3. **Role Management**:
   - Admins should have full access to student management features (add/edit/delete students and courses).
   - Students can only view and enroll in courses, and update their own profile information.
   
4. **Database Structure**:
   - The system uses separate tables for `students`, `courses`, and a junction table `student_courses` to manage the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
   - The `admins` table stores admin user data separately from students.
